**Getting Started:**
To set up The Kickoff locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Composer Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
   This command installs all PHP dependencies required by Laravel.

2. **Generate Application Key:**
   Laravel requires an application key for encryption. Generate it using Artisan:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Run MySQL Migrations:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

4. **Serve the Application:**
   Start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

5. **Explore Laravel Documentation:**
   For more details on how to use Laravel, refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).
